# Kotlin Course Translations

This is the open source repository for the 9+ Hour FREE course on the [Kotlin programming language available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuiT4T_LJQo).

## Translations

Currently there is only the US captions. Based upon viewing statistics I would love to get this course open to as many people as possible. 

The most popular languages for viewing countries are as follows: 

1. Hindi
2. Bengali
3. Spanish
4. French
... I'm open to other languages too, these just happen to be the most popular based upon the YouTube audience statistics. If you don't see your language listed there, you can still contribute with your language!


## Contributing 

Pull requests are welcome and encouraged. Its the only way this course will get translated! :) 

Fork the repository, and create or modify the language file that contains the language you can help with. If the file does not exist, create it using the ISO 639-2 format with the country. 

Example: 
English US: en-us.srt
Spanish US: es-us.srt
Hindi India: hi-in.srt

_You do not have to complete the entire translation! If you can help with one sentence, or a few here and there, that's great!_

Once the file is complete and reviewed I will upload the translations to the course on YouTube.
